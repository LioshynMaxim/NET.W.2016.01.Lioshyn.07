Refactoring. Implement the algorithm of "bubble" sort-rectangular integer array (System.Array class sorting methods did not use) so as to be able to order the rows:

* in ascending order (descending) of amounts of elements rows of the matrix;
* in ascending order (descending) of maximal elements of the rows of the matrix;
* in ascending order (descending) of minimal elements of matrix rows.
